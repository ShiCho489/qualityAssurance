- [src](#)


## Activity 3
- Use the supertest package to write a test that makes an HTTP GET request to the /api/workouts url. Verify that the blog list application returns the correct number of workouts in the JSON format.

- Write a test that verifies that making an HTTP POST request to the /api/workouts url successfully creates a new workout. At the very least, verify that the total number of workouts in the system is increased by one. You can also verify that the content of the workout post is saved correctly to the database.

## Bonus: 
Use the supertest package to test all endpoints in the workouts-app. You can use the the code in part4-6 as a guideline.
